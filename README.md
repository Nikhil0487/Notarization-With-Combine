# Notarization-With-Combine

CLI tool based on Combine framework for notarizing macOS software.
This tool is still a WIP. 
The CLI tool intends to use
1. Swift's Argument parser for parsing arguments,
2. Apple's Combine framework for handling notarization declaratively,

Basic outline using Combine has been implemented. Testing and wrapping the tool with Argument Parser is pending.
